*"I intend a generated novel with chapters marking days of a cyber breach. Each day/chapter starts with a generated image of a tarot card followed by a generated tarot commentary and then some text (email, diary) related to that day. Data source is my calendar and sanitized data from an actual data breach. I am writing the code in Julia."*
